# Objectives:
We are going to focus on four learning objectives:

1. Understand the theory behind support vector machines.
2. Builld SVM models with scikit-learn to classify linear and non-linear data.
3. Determine the strengths and limitations of SVMs.
4. Develop an SVM-based facial recognition model.
